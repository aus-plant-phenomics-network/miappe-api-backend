Biological material ID	Code used to identify the biological material in the data file. Should be unique within the Investigation. Can correspond to experimental plant ID, seed lot ID, etc� This material identification is different from a BiosampleID which corresponds to Observation Unit or Samples sections below.	INRA:W95115_inra_2001; INRA:inra_kernel_2351; Rothamsted:rres_GK090847	Unique identifier	1
Organism	An identifier for the organism at the species level. Use of the NCBI taxon ID is recommended. 	NCBITAXON:4577 	Unique identifier	1
Genus	Genus name for the organism under study, according to standard scientific nomenclature.	"Zea
Solanum"	Genus name	0-1
Species	Species name (formally: specific epithet) for the organism under study, according to standard scientific nomenclature.	"mays
lycosperium x pennellii"	Species name	0-1
Infraspecific name	Name of any subtaxa level, including variety, crossing name, etc. It can be used to store any additional taxonomic identifier. Either free text description or key-value pair list format (the key is the name of the rank and the value is the value of  the rank). Ranks can be among the following terms: subspecies, cultivar, variety, subvariety, convariety, group, subgroup, hybrid, line, form, subform. For MCPD compliance, the following abbreviations are allowed: �subsp.� (subspecies); �convar.� (convariety); �var.� (variety); �f.� (form); �Group� (cultivar group).	"vinifera Pinot noir

Biological material altitude	Altitude of the studied biological material, provided in meters (m). [Alternative identifier for in situ material]	10 m	Numeric + unit abbreviation	0-1
Biological material coordinates uncertainty	Circular uncertainty of the coordinates, preferably provided in meters (m). [Alternative identifier for in situ material]	200 m	Numeric	0-1
Biological material preprocessing	Description of any process or treatment applied uniformly to the biological material, prior to the study itself. Can be provided as free text or as an accession number from a suitable controlled vocabulary.

Material source ID (Holding institute/stock centre, accession)	"An identifier for the source of the biological material, in the form of a key-value pair comprising the name/identifier of the repository from which the material was sourced plus the accession number of the repository for that material. Where an accession number has not been assigned, but the material has been derived from the crossing of known accessions, the material can be defined as follows: ""mother_accession X father_accession"", or, if father is unknown, as ""mother_accession X UNKNOWN"". For in situ material, the region of provenance may be used when an accession is not available."	"INRA:W95115_inra
