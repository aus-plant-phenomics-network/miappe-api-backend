Observation unit ID	Identifier used to identify the observation unit in data files containing the values observed or measured on that unit. Must be locally unique. 	plot:894	Unique identifier	1
Observation unit type	Type of observation unit in textual form, usually one of the following: study, block, sub-block, plot, sub-plot, pot, plant. Use of other observation unit types is possible but not recommended. The observation unit type cannot be used to indicate sub-plant levels. However, observations can still be made on the sub-plant level, as long as the details are indicated in the associated observed variable (see observed variables). Alternatively, it is possible to use samples for more detailed tracing of sub-plant units, attaching the observations to them instead.	plot	Free text	1
External ID	Identifier for the observation unit in a persistent repository, comprises the name of the repository and the identifier of the observation unit therein. The EBI Biosamples repository can be used. URI are recommended when possible.	Biosamples:SAMEA4202911	Unique identifier	0+
Spatial distribution	Type and value of a spatial coordinate (georeference or relative) or level of observation (plot 45, subblock 7, block 2) provided as a key-value pair of the form type:value. Levels of observation must be consistent with those listed in the Study section.	latitude:+2.341; row:4 ; X:3; Y:6; Xm:35; Ym:65; block:1; plot:894; replicate:1	Formatted text (Key:value)	0+
Observation Unit factor value	List of values for each factor applied to the observation unit.	Watered	Free text	0+
